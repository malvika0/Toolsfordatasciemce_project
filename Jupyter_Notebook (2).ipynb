    "- SciPy- It is a free and open-source Python library for data science that is extensively used for high-level computations.\n",
    "- NumPy- It provides fast, pre-compiled functions for numerical routines\n",
    "- Pandas- It is the most popular and widely used Python library for data science, along with NumPy in matplotlib as it provides High-level abstraction.\n",
    "- Matplotlib- Matplotlib has powerful yet beautiful visualizations. Because of the graphs and plots that it produces, itâ€™s extensively used for data visualization.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn- This library provides almost all the machine learning algorithms, it is designed to be interpolated into NumPy and SciPy.\n",
    "- PyTorch- It is one of the most commonly preferred deep learning research platforms built to provide maximum flexibility and speed.\n",
    "- Scrapy- It is one of the most popular, fast, open-source web crawling frameworks written in Python. It is commonly used to extract the data from the web page with the help of selectors based on XPath.\n",
